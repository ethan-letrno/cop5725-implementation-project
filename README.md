# cop5725-implementation-project

Implementation in C++ of the algorithms described in the 2016 ICDE paper "A Novel, Low-latency Algorithm for Multiple Group-By Query Optimization".

For each .table file, the naming convention is (name of table)(number of rows).table, wherein "k" is shorthand for thousand and "m" for million.


# To Do

1. create working naive solution
2. 'optimized' solution works similarly to naive but executes based on tree structure from (3)
3. algorithms from paper that create an optimal tree
    - algorithm 1
    - algorithm 6
